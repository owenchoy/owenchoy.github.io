[Program Participant \| University of California Nature Reserve System]{.h4}

In the summer of 2023, I participated in [California Ecology and Conservation](https://ucnrs.org/teaching/cec/), a field study program hosted by the UC Nature Reserve System (NRS). Over the course of 7 weeks, a cohort of undergraduate students from various UC campuses and I traveled to 5 different NRS nature reserves to learn about various topics in ecology, biology, field research, experimental design, statistical analysis, and scientific writing and presenting. Field research methods I conducted included sub-sampling techniques, water sampling, physical tree measurements, phenological data collection, and aquatic macroinvertebrate identification. I analyzed field data with JMP Statistical Software and Microsoft Excel and gained familiarity of a variety of flora and fauna across California. The progression of my work culminated several research projects that included a paper and a presentation. I played a large role in three research projects studying:

-   the correlation between dead biomass and the presence pitch canker disease in Monterey Pines

-   [the influence of snowpack and temperature on the phenology of several montane chaparral species in the Eastern Sierra Nevada](https://owenchoy.github.io/portfolio/phenology/)

-    [algae and diatoms in a freshwater stream and its interrelation with stream characteristics and the aquatic macroinvertebrate commmunity](https://owenchoy.github.io/portfolio/algae/)

[Exchange Program | University of California Education Abroad Program]{.h4}

My desire to travel the world and learn from a new physical and mental perspective led me to a semester abroad on an exchange program at the National University of Singapore in Singapore. Located over 8,000 miles away from home, I had no trouble getting accustomed to the physical and cultural environment. I fell in love with the nation through its amazing food, people, natural (and unnatural) landscapes, built infrastructure, public transportation system, and the nation's drive to be a global leader in business and sustainability despite its small size. I took classes on the social perspectives of public infrastructure, weather and climate, energy systems, and the influence of Western classical music on Singapore's history and present state. But above that, I learned what it was like to live in a different country, surrounded by people with perspectives drastically different than my own. It was an enriching experience that I hope to continue someday in the future.^[I made a (very rough) guide to Singapore tourism and food.
