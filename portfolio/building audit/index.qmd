# [The Project]{.red-text}

This report expresses my findings of a simple building audit I conducted on the University Center on the campus of UC Santa Barbara. This project was completed as an assignment for my Green Building course. I examined the building and assessed its features, fixtures, and practices in reference to the US Green Building Council's (USGBC) version 4 (v4) LEED Scorecard for Operations and Maintenance in school buildings. Some of the categories within the scorecard that I assessed include location, sustainability, water and energy efficiency, materials use, and indoor air quality. Additionally, I conducted water and energy analyses using the USGBC LEED v4 Indoor Water Use Reduction Calculator and ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager to evaluate the building's energy and water usage. I also offer insight into areas of improvement to enhance sustainability and energy and water efficiency.

# [The Experience]{.red-text}

This building audit was unlike any other project I had done before. I enjoyed looking around the building, analyzing design features, building practices, and areas of improvement with the expertise I had gained from the Green Building course. With a notepad and pen in hand, I felt like a professional. I even looked like one too. Building staff noticed me and at one point I was even asked what company I was with after telling an onlooker that I was conducting a building audit. This was a fun project to complete and I enjoyed working through the entire process.
