# [The Project]{.red-text}

This project was conducted during my time at California Ecology and Conservation. My cohort and I were stationed in the Eastern Sierra Nevada at the NRS's Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory (SNARL) conducted the field research at SNARL's sister reserve, Valentine Camp, near the skiing town of Mammoth, California. This project was conducted by a team of 4, but the paper was completed on an individual basis. My team and I were interested in the potentnial influence of snowfall or temperature on the phenophases of plants within the area. A phenophase is a crucial stage in the life cycle of an organism. In plants, phenophases can include flowering or blooming, fruiting, seed dispersal, and leaf senescence or death. We sought to identify differences in the timing of the flowering stage across multiple years using a database of phenological data collected by volunteers at Valentine Camp through the California Phenology Project. Since the wet season in the early part of 2023 saw record-breaking levels of snowfall in the Sierra Nevada which allowed snowpack to be higher than normal later in the season (snow in July!), we compared phenological data between years of increased precipitation and decreased precipitation with an average baseline to determine the influence of snowpack on plant phenology.

We found that increased snowpack did delay flowering time of three out of the four study species, while temperature did not have an effect. This suggests that as the variability in weather conditions like precipitation continue to change, likely due to the effects of climate change, it can have a lasting impact on ground vegetation. This can have ecosystem-wide impacts as well. For instance, many plants rely on flowering around the same time as other plants to increase attraction for pollinators in a process called co-flowering. A change in the flowering time of plants like these can cause them to become out of sync with their co-flowering companions, and with key pollinators and seed dispersers. Invasive plants can also exploit the delayed phenological timing of native plants by utilizing resources or colonizing land while native plants are inactive, which can alter the natural landscape. Animals that rely on plants for food resources may also be affected. This study demonstrates how just one facet of climate change can have intricate and profound effects.

# [The Accomplishment]{.red-text}

Writing this paper was quite the accomplishment for me. This was the first full-length research paper I had written from research that I had conducted. The deadline was extremely tight with only 10 days total for conceptualizing the study, conducting background literature research, running pilot tests, performing field and online research, and presenting our findings; and within that period, only 4 days of paper writing. 4 days to write a full-length research paper! Across all four days, my team members constantly found me laying or sitting in bed, typing away at my laptop. We were in a cabin in Yosemite: no desks, limited internet access, and stuck inside working instead of being outside enjoying one of the most beautiful places in the country. Sometimes, when I was tired of my bed, my friends found me standing on the mini staircase of our cabin, finding the next best thing to a standing desk to stretch out my legs while I worked myself away. 

But all the long nights, early mornings, and skipped meals were worth it. When I received my grade back

- spending long hours writing
- tight deadline
- yosemite
- no desk, in bed/stairs
- sacrificing time
- the acccomplishment (many rename section title): earned highest grade, hard work pays off, in a room full of nerds
