# [The Project]{.red-text}

This document is a conservation plan for the giant river otter <em>Pteronura brasiliensis</em>. It was completed by a group of 4 of us for a course called Conservation Planning. Within the report, we provide detailed descriptions on the rationale behind the project, members of the planning team and stakeholders, the fundamental objectives and desired outcomes, a situation analysis using Miradi software, a threat and risk analysis, and an in-depth analysis on multiple conservation strategies.
