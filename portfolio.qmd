This page houses some pieces of my work from the past few years. Currently, it includes a variety of projects, including two research papers, a building audit, a conservation plan, and a mock conservation bill. All of these projects were completed as a part of coursework. In the future, I hope to polish up some of my old projects for display and include new projects as well.
