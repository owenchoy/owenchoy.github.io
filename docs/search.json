    "text": "The Project\nThis project was conducted during my time at California Ecology and Conservation. My cohort and I were stationed in the Eastern Sierra Nevada at the NRS’s Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory (SNARL) conducted the field research at SNARL’s sister reserve, Valentine Camp, near the skiing town of Mammoth, California. This project was conducted by a team of 4, but the paper was completed on an individual basis. My team and I were interested in the potentnial influence of snowfall or temperature on the phenophases of plants within the area. A phenophase is a crucial stage in the life cycle of an organism. In plants, phenophases can include flowering or blooming, fruiting, seed dispersal, and leaf senescence or death. We sought to identify differences in the timing of the flowering stage across multiple years using a database of phenological data collected by volunteers at Valentine Camp through the California Phenology Project. Since the wet season in the early part of 2023 saw record-breaking levels of snowfall in the Sierra Nevada which allowed snowpack to be higher than normal later in the season (snow in July!), we compared phenological data between years of increased precipitation and decreased precipitation with an average baseline to determine the influence of snowpack on plant phenology.\n\nWe found that increased snowpack did delay flowering time of three out of the four study species, while temperature did not have an effect. This suggests that as the variability in weather conditions like precipitation continue to change, likely due to the effects of climate change, it can have a lasting impact on ground vegetation. This can have ecosystem-wide impacts as well. For instance, many plants rely on flowering around the same time as other plants to increase attraction for pollinators in a process called co-flowering. A change in the flowering time of plants like these can cause them to become out of sync with their co-flowering companions, and with key pollinators and seed dispersers. Invasive plants can also exploit the delayed phenological timing of native plants by utilizing resources or colonizing land while native plants are inactive, which can alter the natural landscape. Animals that rely on plants for food resources may also be affected. This study demonstrates how just one facet of climate change can have intricate and profound effects.\n\n\n\nMontane chaparral plants in the foreground in the Sierra Nevada.\n\n\n\nThe Accomplishment\nWriting this paper was quite the accomplishment for me. This was the first full-length research paper I had written from research that I had conducted. The deadline was extremely tight with only 10 days total for conceptualizing the study, conducting background literature research, running pilot tests, performing field and online research, and presenting our findings; and within that period, only 4 days of paper writing. 4 days to write a full-length research paper! Across all four days, my team members constantly found me laying or sitting in bed, typing away at my laptop. We were in a cabin in Yosemite: no desks, limited internet access, and stuck inside working instead of being outside enjoying one of the most beautiful places in the country. Sometimes, when I was tired of my bed, my friends found me standing on the mini staircase of our cabin, finding the next best thing to a standing desk to stretch out my legs while I worked myself away.\n\nBut all the long nights, early mornings, and skipped meals were worth it. The relief I felt after submitting my paper for grading was only surpassed by the joy from seeing my grade. Shortly after the professors explained they were grading our papers hard so that we understood what we needed to improve upon, I found myself face to face with an A letter grade, the only one in my cohort. I was relieved that after all the work I put into the project, it was recognized by my superiors and paid off nicely. But the achievement was more than that. Since the start of the program, it was evident to me that I lacked the experience and drive my fellow classmates had. I hadn’t worked in a research lab. I wasn’t working 3 jobs with another one already lined up after graduation. I wasn’t an expert in any specific area like many of my classmates were. In a class full of some of the brightest students in ecology, biology, and environmental sciences/studies across the UCs, I found my place among them. I wasn’t concerned about gaining respect from others, but I gained a lot of respect for myself. I learned that even when I may be surrounded and outshone by peers that are more experienced or more knowledgable than I am, I can still excel as myself and my own qualities will find a way to shine in the right moment.\n\n\nThe Product\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also read the article here: The effect of snowpack and temperature on the phenology of montane chaparral species."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Project\nThis research paper is the product of a research project I conducted with three other UC undergraduate students during our California Ecology and Conservation program in the summer of 2023. The study was conducted on the South Fork Eel River in the Angelo Coast Range Reserve in northern California. We focused our study on algae and diatoms, two types of primary producers highly prevalent in the Eel River that grow horizontally and vertically from the bottom of the river (referred to as periphyton). Across a 5-day period of data collection and over just a 2-week span, we examined the effect of stream water flow characteristics on the abundance of algae and diatoms in the river, as well as how both of these factors influenced the aquatic macroinvertebrate density and community composition that lived within the producers.\n\nOur findings have greater implications in conservation and management, providing experimental evidence to support the protection of streams. We found that the flow of the water in the stream influenced the abundance of periphyton and macroinvertebrate density, which form the base of the food web in river ecosystems. This means that any abnormal impact on water flow from causes such as dams, stream diversion for agriculture, or the effects of climate change can have a cascading effect on the ecosystem. For instance, too much water at a high velocity can wash away periphyton and aquatic macroinvertebrates. On the other hand, too little water, especially in the summer when the water level is naturally low, can cause periphyton to become stagnate and decompose, releasing large amounts of nutrients that are ideal for harmful cyanobacteria to grow. The sensitivity of river ecosystems due to variability in stream flow make the preservation and close monitoring of this ecosystem highly critical.\n\n\n\nThe study site: the South Fork Eel River.\n\n\n\nThe Experience\nDuring this research project, I learned a lot about the ecology of freshwater stream systems, algae and diatoms, aquatic macroinvertebrate identification, data analysis using JMP Software, and paper writing. My projects and research in the past usually dealt with stationary components: plants and with my feet planted on the ground (quadrats are so much easier to analyze when they’re not moving!). So trudging my way through chest-high waters while collecting samples of wavering pieces of algae without getting water into my waders was quite the experience. The macro- and microinvertebrates constantly moving around in our little petri dishes while trying to pick them up and identify them under a microscope is hard to forget, too. But the experience was rewarding. On an ecological level, I learned about algae and diatoms and their trophic interactions and their role in stream health. I learned about the orders and groups of some common macroinvertebrates in freshwater streams and how to identify them. I even started to dive into the minute world of aquatic microorganisms because I was fascinated by the tiny dots that can barely be seen with the naked eye darting around in the water (which was beyond the scope of our project but amazing to see!).\n\nAnd of course, the outcome of this work was also the fulfillment of the development of interpersonal skills. I learned a lot about patience, collaboration, and how to deal with roadblocks within the group and project. My team and I were under a strict time crunch for this project and thus under a lot of stress. The whole thing was conceptualized, piloted, reworked, fully conducted, statistically analyzed, written, presented, and prepared for publication in the span of two weeks. That left very little room for troubleshooting errors or time to refine the research process. We spent long days traversing through the river to collect water and periphyton samples to analyze in our makeshift lab the same evening.\n\n\n\nThe Product\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also read the article here: Relationship between River Water Flow Rate, Periphyton Abundance and Macroinvertebrate Communities."

This project was completed as an assignment for my Green Building course. I examined the building and assessed its features, fixtures, and practices in reference to the US Green Building Council’s (USGBC) version 4 (v4) LEED Scorecard for Operations and Maintenance in school buildings. Some of the categories within the scorecard that I assessed include location, sustainability, water and energy efficiency, materials use, and indoor air quality. Additionally, I conducted water and energy analyses using the USGBC LEED v4 Indoor Water Use Reduction Calculator and ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager to evaluate the building’s energy and water usage. I also offer insight into areas of improvement to enhance sustainability and energy and water efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe front of the University Center at the main entrance.\n\n\n\nThe Experience\nThis building audit was unlike any other project I had done before. I enjoyed looking around the building, analyzing design features, building practices, and areas of improvement with the expertise I had gained from the Green Building course. With a notepad and pen in hand, I felt like a professional. I even looked like one too. Building staff noticed me and at one point I was even asked what company I was with after telling an onlooker that I was conducting a building audit. This was a fun project to complete and I enjoyed working through the entire process.\n\n\nThe Product\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also read the article here: Case Study: University Center."
