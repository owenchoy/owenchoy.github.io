My projects and research in the past usually dealt with stationary components: plants and with my feet planted on the ground (quadrats are so much easier to analyze when they’re not moving!). So trudging my way through chest-high waters while collecting samples of wavering pieces of algae without getting water into my waders was quite the experience. The macro- and microinvertebrates constantly moving around in our little petri dishes while trying to pick them up and identify them under a microscope is hard to forget, too. But the experience was rewarding. On an ecological level, I learned about algae and diatoms and their trophic interactions and their role in stream health. I learned about the orders and groups of some common macroinvertebrates in freshwater streams and how to identify them. I even started to dive into the minute world of aquatic microorganisms because I was fascinated by the tiny dots that can barely be seen with the naked eye darting around in the water (which was beyond the scope of our project but amazing to see!).\nAnd of course, the product of me and my collaborators’ work was also the fulfillment of the development of my interpersonal skills.

    "text": "The Project\nThis research paper is the product of a research project I conducted with three other UC undergraduate students during our California Ecology and Conservation program in the summer of 2023. The study was conducted on the South Fork Eel River in the Angelo Coast Range Reserve in northern California. We focused our study on algae and diatoms, two types of primary producers highly prevalent in the Eel River that grow horizontally and vertically from the bottom of the river (referred to as periphyton). Across a 5-day period of data collection and over just a 2-week span, we examined the effect of stream water flow characteristics on the abundance of algae and diatoms in the river, as well as how both of these factors influenced the aquatic macroinvertebrate density and community composition that lived within the producers.\n\nOur findings have greater implications in conservation and management, providing experimental evidence to support the protection of streams. We found that the flow of the water in the stream influenced the abundance of periphyton and macroinvertebrate density, which form the base of the food web in river ecosystems. This means that any abnormal impact on water flow from causes such as dams, stream diversion for agriculture, or the effects of climate change can have a cascading effect on the ecosystem. For instance, too much water at a high velocity can wash away periphyton and aquatic macroinvertebrates. On the other hand, too little water, especially in the summer when the water level is naturally low, can cause periphyton to become stagnate and decompose, releasing large amounts of nutrients that are ideal for harmful cyanobacteria to grow. The sensitivity of river ecosystems due to variability in stream flow make the preservation and close monitoring of this ecosystem highly critical.\n\n\n\nThe study site: the South Fork Eel River.\n\n\n\nThe Experience\nDuring this research project, I learned a lot about the ecology of freshwater stream systems, algae and diatoms, aquatic macroinvertebrate identification, data analysis using JMP Software, and paper writing.

    "text": "About Me\n\n\nHey there! I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am graduating this year (2024) with a BS in Environmental Studies. My broad background includes a wide range of fields including ecology, conservation, sustainability, environmental monitoring and planning, green building, renewable energy systems, and climate change mitigation. Recently, I have been picking up skills in online applications, including coding in Python and R, statistical analysis using JMP Statistical Software and R, and documentation with Quarto. I am currently looking for an entry-level position in any of these fields in the Bay Area or Orange County in California.\n\n\n\nBeyond studying, collecting data in the field or running tests in the lab, I spend lots of my time outdoors. I have a strong passion for sports, with basketball being my longtime favorite and intermittent play in football, volleyball, soccer, ultimate frisbee, ping pong, spikeball, and crossnet! I enjoy hiking and tidepooling and admiring the wildlife around me. Indoors, I like to play board games like strategy games, social deduction games, and card games. I also tremendously enjoy cooking and baking and am always looking to try a new recipe!"
